Kibana Armed Bandit
===================

Logging is key in every setup: having useful logs from the components in your
environment is your best tool in diagnosing issues and keeping track of
the health of your applications.

Docker-based deployments are no exception of this rule. In this training we will evaluate kibana features, upon reaching an E*K stack.

This project is the workshop part of the [Kibana training](https://git.renault-digital.com/common/training/tree/master/kibana)
